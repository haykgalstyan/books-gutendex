Architecture may be an overkill for such a small project but we don't want to limit any project's growth potential. :)

The top-level packages: domain, data, and presentation follow dependency inversion and can be easily modularized when needed.

This is nearly finished, there are bugs, but unfortunately its a very busy time for me and would be hard to spend more time :/ 
I hope the arch and the rest will be appreciated though
