Architecture may be an overkill for such a small project but we don't want to limit any project's growth potential. :)

The top-level packages: domain, data, and presentation follow dependency inversion and can be easily modularized when needed.

There are some bugs but unfortunately its a busy period for me and I wouln't be able to spend more time on it to make it perfect.
